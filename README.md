Bachelor Thesis
This repository contains files that related to the bachelor thesis in Reinforcement Learning (RL) made by Cristofer Tamayo. In here you find Python files that contain code of the different algorithms and also functions for plotting the results of different experiments. You find also the experiments that were made to create the results discussed in the thesis.

About the thesis
The thesis compares the behavior of two RL algorithms, SARSA and Q-learning. The respective learning curves were plotted to be able to do a comparison between the behavior of the algorithms.
